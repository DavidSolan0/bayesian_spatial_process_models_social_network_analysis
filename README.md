# Bayesian Spatial Process Models for Social Network Analysis
This repo contains the codes in R and Cpp to replicate the original proposal of [Linkletter](https://github.com/DavidSolan0/bayesian_spatial_process_models_social_network_analysis/tree/main/likletter) (2007) of a Bayesian Spatial Process Models for Social Network Analysis and our proposal using an estimation of the likelihood function based on [Raftery et al.](https://github.com/DavidSolan0/bayesian_spatial_process_models_social_network_analysis/tree/main/raftery) (2012). The reader interested in theoretical details can consult this [document](https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/82234).
