
The computational cost of the Linkletter original proposal for a network of $n$ nodes is equal to $O(n^2)$, which makes its implementation unfeasible for big networks. Raftery et al. (2012) replaces the complete likelihood function in the MCMC procedure with an unbiased estimation through the epidemiological approach of cases and controls, reducing the computational cost to $O(n)$. This folder, more precisely, the **synthetic.R** script contains the implementation of this procedure. Theorical details can be found in chapter 6 [here](https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/82234).
