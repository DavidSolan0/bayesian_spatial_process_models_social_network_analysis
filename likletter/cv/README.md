Here we dispose of the codes to do a cv of the model, we implemented a 5-folds cv, but you can change the number of folders according to your goals. In the **dist_parallel.R**, you must verify if the rtools file corresponds to the one we used. Finally, if you want to check the imputation process using the log-likelihood function, you can go to **dist_functions.R**.
